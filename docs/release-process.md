This guide illustrates how to perform a release for Apache DotPulsar.

In general, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Update the version and tag of a package.
2. Create a GitHub prerelease.
3. Download the source code.
4. Sign and stage the artifacts.
5. Run a vote.
6. Summary of vote.
7. Promote the release.
8. Create a GitHub release.
9. Announce the release.

#### Managing backporting of patches
When we need to create a backporting patch, we simply create a branch for the version that requires the backport.
We can easily locate a specific version using git tags. We do not create a branch until the actual need arises.

### Requirements
- [Creating GPG keys to sign release artifacts](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/create-gpg-keys/)

## Versioning
Bump up the version number as follows.

* Major version (e.g. 2.8.0 => 3.0.0)
    * Changes that break backward compatibility
* Minor version (e.g. 2.8.0 => 2.9.0)
    * Backward compatible new features
* Patch version (e.g. 2.8.0 => 2.8.1)
    * Backward compatible bug fixes

## Steps in detail

**In these instructions, I'm referring to an fictitious release `X.X.X`. Change the release version in the examples accordingly with the real version.**

1. Update the version and tag of a package.

Update the information of the new release in the `DotPulsar.csproj` and `CHANGELOG.md` files and send a PR for with the changes.

Be sure to make the commit message `Make ready for release X.X.X-rc-X`

2. Create a GitHub prerelease.

Browse to https://github.com/apache/pulsar-dotpulsar/releases/new

Create a tag `X.X.X-rc-X`

Create a release title: `DotPulsar X.X.X-rc-X`

Generated release notes.

Make sure the `Set as a pre-release` checkbox is checked!

Publish the release.

3. Download the source code.

Browse to https://github.com/apache/pulsar-dotpulsar/releases to download the source code in tar.gz.

4. Sign and stage the artifacts.

The src artifact need to be signed and uploaded to the dist SVN repository for staging.

```
$ gpg -b --armor pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X-src.tar.gz
$ shasum -a 512 pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X-src.tar.gz > pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X-src.tar.gz.sha512 
```

Checkout repo for uploading artifacts
```
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/pulsar pulsar-dist-dev
$ cd pulsar-dist-dev
```

Create a candidate directory at the root repo
```
$ svn mkdir pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X-rc-1
$ cd pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X-rc-1
```

Copy the signed artifacts into the rc directory and commit
```
$ cp ../apache-pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X-* .
$ svn add *
$ svn ci -m 'Staging artifacts and signature for DotPulsar X.X.X-rc-1'
```

5. Run a vote.

7. Promote the release.

Promote the artifacts on the release location (need PMC permissions):
```
svn move -m "release 0.X.0" https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/pulsar/pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X-rc-1 \
         https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/pulsar/pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X
Remove the old releases (if any). We only need the latest release there, older releases are available through the Apache archive:
```

Get the list of releases
```
svn ls https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/pulsar | grep dotpulsar
```

Delete each release (except for the last one)
```
svn rm https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/pulsar/pulsar-dotpulsar/pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X
``` 

8. Create a GitHub release.

Browse to https://github.com/apache/pulsar-dotpulsar/releases/new

If the head of the master branch has moved and therefore the last commit is not named `Make ready for release X.X.X-rc-X`.
Then change the Target from master to Recent Commits that matches `Make ready for release X.X.X-rc-X`

Create a tag `X.X.X`.

Create a release title: `DotPulsar X.X.X`

To Generated release notes select the 'Previous tag: X.X.X' where X.X.X is the last non rc version.

Make sure the `Set as the latest release` checkbox is checked!

9. Announce the release.

Once the release process is available , you can announce the release and send an email as below:

```

This guide illustrates how to perform a release for Apache DotPulsar.

In general, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Version Update & Tagging.
2. GitHub Prerelease Creation.
3. Source Code Download.
4. Artifact Staging & Signing.
5. Voting Process Execution.
6. Vote Summary.
7. Release Artifacts.
8. GitHub Release Creation.
9. Release Announcement.

#### Managing backporting of patches
When we need to create a backporting patch, we simply create a branch for the version that requires the backport.
We can easily locate a specific version using git tags. We do not create a branch until the actual need arises.

### Requirements
- [Creating GPG keys to sign release artifacts](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/create-gpg-keys/)

## Versioning
Bump up the version number as follows.

* Major version (e.g. 2.8.0 => 3.0.0)
    * Changes that break backward compatibility
* Minor version (e.g. 2.8.0 => 2.9.0)
    * Backward compatible new features
* Patch version (e.g. 2.8.0 => 2.8.1)
    * Backward compatible bug fixes

## Steps in detail

**In these instructions, I'm referring to an fictitious release `X.X.X`. Change the release version in the examples accordingly with the real version.**

1. Version Update & Tagging.

Update the information in `CHANGELOG.md` and send a PR for with the changes.

Be sure to make the commit message `Make ready for release X.X.X-rc.X`

2. GitHub Prerelease Creation.

Browse to https://github.com/apache/pulsar-dotpulsar/releases/new

Create a tag `X.X.X-rc.X`

Create a release title: `DotPulsar X.X.X-rc.X`

Generated release notes.

Make sure the `Set as a pre-release` checkbox is checked!

Publish the release.

3. Source Code Download.

Browse to https://github.com/apache/pulsar-dotpulsar/releases to download the source code in tar.gz.

4. Artifact Staging & Signing.

The src artifact need to be signed and uploaded to the dist SVN repository for staging.

```
$ gpg -b --armor pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X-src.tar.gz
$ shasum -a 512 pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X-src.tar.gz > pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X-src.tar.gz.sha512 
```

Create a candidate directory for uploading artifacts, and then check it out:

```
$ svn mkdir -m "Create DotPulsar pre-release dir" https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/pulsar/pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X-rc.1
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/pulsar/pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X-rc-1 pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X-rc.1
$ cd pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X-rc.1
```

Copy the signed artifacts into the rc directory and commit
```
$ cp ../apache-pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X-* .
$ svn add *
$ svn ci -m 'Staging artifacts and signature for DotPulsar X.X.X-rc.1'
```

7. Release Artifacts.

Promote the artifacts on the release location (need PMC permissions):
```
svn move -m "release 0.X.0" https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/pulsar/pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X-rc.1 \
         https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/pulsar/pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X
Remove the old releases (if any). We only need the latest release there, older releases are available through the Apache archive:
```

Get the list of releases
```
svn ls https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/pulsar | grep dotpulsar
```

Delete each release (except for the last one)
```
svn rm https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/pulsar/pulsar-dotpulsar/pulsar-dotpulsar-X.X.X
``` 

8. GitHub Release Creation.

Browse to https://github.com/apache/pulsar-dotpulsar/releases/new

If the head of the master branch has moved and therefore the last commit is not named `Make ready for release X.X.X-rc.X`.
Then change the Target from master to Recent Commits that matches `Make ready for release X.X.X-rc.X`

Create a tag `X.X.X`.

Create a release title: `DotPulsar X.X.X`

To Generated release notes select the 'Previous tag: X.X.X' where X.X.X is the last non rc version.

Make sure the `Set as the latest release` checkbox is checked!

This guide illustrates how to perform a release for Apache DotPulsar.

In general, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Version Update & Tagging.
2. GitHub Prerelease Creation.
3. Source Code Download.
4. Artifact Staging & Signing.
5. Voting Process Execution.
6. Vote Summary.
7. Release Artifacts.
8. GitHub Release Creation.
9. Release Announcement.

#### Managing backporting of patches
When we need to create a backporting patch, we simply create a branch for the version that requires the backport.
We can easily locate a specific version using git tags. We do not create a branch until the actual need arises.

### Requirements
- [Creating GPG keys to sign release artifacts](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/create-gpg-keys/)

## Versioning
Bump up the version number as follows.

* Major version (e.g. 2.8.0 => 3.0.0)
    * Changes that break backward compatibility
* Minor version (e.g. 2.8.0 => 2.9.0)
    * Backward compatible new features
* Patch version (e.g. 2.8.0 => 2.8.1)
    * Backward compatible bug fixes

## Steps in detail

Define the version to be released (adjust to the real version):

```shell
export DOTPULSAR_VERSION=3.0.0
export DOTPULSAR_VERSION_RC=3.0.0-rc.1
```

1. Version Update & Tagging.

Update the information in `CHANGELOG.md` and send a PR with the changes.

Be sure to make the commit message `Make ready for release $DOTPULSAR_VERSION_RC`

2. GitHub Prerelease Creation.

Browse to https://github.com/apache/pulsar-dotpulsar/releases/new

Create a tag `$DOTPULSAR_VERSION_RC`

Create a release title: `DotPulsar $DOTPULSAR_VERSION_RC`

Navigate to the GitHub page for Pulsar at https://github.com/apache/pulsar-dotpulsar/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md. Locate the specific version labeled X.X.X-rc.X in the changelog and transfer all the modifications or updates listed for that version into the designated 'Describe this release' text box. 

Make sure the `Set as a pre-release` checkbox is checked!

Publish the release.

3. Source Code Packaging.

Check out the RC tag and package source code into a tarball:

```shell
git checkout $DOTPULSAR_VERSION_RC
git archive --format=tar.gz \
  --output="$(pwd)/pulsar-dotpulsar-$DOTPULSAR_VERSION_RC/pulsar-dotpulsar-$DOTPULSAR_VERSION-src.tar.gz" \
  --prefix="pulsar-dotpulsar-$DOTPULSAR_VERSION-src"
```

4. Artifact Staging & Signing.

The src artifact need to be signed and uploaded to the dist SVN repository for staging.

```shell
gpg -b --armor pulsar-dotpulsar-$DOTPULSAR_VERSION-src.tar.gz
shasum -a 512 pulsar-dotpulsar-$DOTPULSAR_VERSION-src.tar.gz > pulsar-dotpulsar-$DOTPULSAR_VERSION-src.tar.gz.sha512 
```

Create a candidate directory for uploading artifacts, and then check it out:

```shell
svn mkdir -m "Create DotPulsar pre-release dir" https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/pulsar/pulsar-dotpulsar-$DOTPULSAR_VERSION_RC
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/pulsar/pulsar-dotpulsar-$DOTPULSAR_VERSION_RC
cd pulsar-dotpulsar-$DOTPULSAR_VERSION_RC
```

Copy the signed artifacts into the RC directory and commit

```shell
cp /path/to/pulsar-dotpulsar-$DOTPULSAR_VERSION-src.* .
svn add *
svn ci -m 'Staging artifacts and signature for DotPulsar $DOTPULSAR_VERSION_RC'
```

5. Voting Process Execution.

Send an email to the Pulsar Dev mailing list:

```

7. Release Artifacts.

Promote the artifacts on the release location (need PMC permissions):

```shell
svn move -m "release $DOTPULSAR_VERSION" https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/pulsar/pulsar-dotpulsar-$DOTPULSAR_VERSION_RC \
         https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/pulsar/pulsar-dotpulsar-$DOTPULSAR_VERSION
```

Remove the old releases (if any). We only need the latest release there, older releases are available through the Apache archive.

Get the list of releases:

```shell
svn ls https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/pulsar | grep dotpulsar
```

Delete each release (except for the last one):

```shell
svn rm https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/pulsar/pulsar-dotpulsar/<old-releases>
``` 

8. GitHub Release Creation.

Browse to https://github.com/apache/pulsar-dotpulsar/releases/new

If the head of the master branch has moved and therefore the last commit is not named `Make ready for release $DOTPULSAR_VERSION_RC`.
Then change the Target from master to Recent Commits that matches `Make ready for release $DOTPULSAR_VERSION_RC`

Create a tag `$DOTPULSAR_VERSION`.

Create a release title: `DotPulsar $DOTPULSAR_VERSION`

Visit https://github.com/apache/pulsar-dotpulsar/releases/edit/$DOTPULSAR_VERSION_RC. Proceed to extract the release notes from that specific version and seamlessly insert them into the final release.

Make sure the `Set as the latest release` checkbox is checked!

9. Release Announcement.

Once the release process is available, you can announce the release and send an email as below:

```

# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## Added

- [Tracing](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-dotpulsar/wiki/Tracing) support following the [guidelines](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/messaging.md) from the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) project
    - Sending a message will create a producer trace and add tracing metadata to the message
    - The 'Process' extension method for IConsumer\<TMessage\> is no longer experimental and will create a consumer trace

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Sending a message without metadata is now an extension method and therefore no longer part of the ISend\<TMessage\> (and thereby IProducer\<TMessage\>) interface
- IMessageRouter: ChoosePartition(MessageMetadata? messageMetadata, int numberOfPartitions) -> ChoosePartition(MessageMetadata messageMetadata, int numberOfPartitions)

## [1.1.2] - 2021-07-05

### Fixed

- The partitioned producer didn't pass metadata to the message router

## [1.1.1] - 2021-07-05

### Fixed

- The producer ignored message metadata provided by the user

## [1.1.0] - 2021-06-29

### Added

- The producer now supports partitioned topics
- The IMessageRouter interface with the RoundRobinPartitionRouter (default) and SinglePartitionRouter implementations
- The producer builder accepts a custom implementation of IMessageRouter

### Changed

- The producer state can now be 'PartiallyConnected'
- The KeyBytes property on MessageMetadata returned null if the key was set via a string. Now it will return string keys as UTF8 bytes

### Fixed

- Autogenerate a consumer and reader name when it's not explicitly set by the user

## [1.0.2] - 2021-04-30

### Fixed

- Closing a consumer or reader while the broker is streaming messages could take down the connection causing other consumers, readers, and producers of the connection to reconnect
- In some circumstances, the protocol bytes could be misread leading to wrong messages parsing

## [1.0.1] - 2021-03-30

### Fixed

- Creating a producer with a schema for a non-existing topic failed

## [1.0.0] - 2021-03-17

### Added

- A number of resilience, correctness, and performance improvements
- The optional listener name can be set via the PulsarClientBuilder
- *Experimental*: Added an extension method for IConsumer that will 'Process' and auto-acknowledge messages while creating an Activity (useful for doing tracing)
- Schema support for the following types
    - Boolean
    - Bytes (using byte[] and ReadOnlySequence\<byte\>)
    - String (UTF-8, UTF-16, and US-ASCII)
    - INT8, INT16, INT32, and INT64
    - Float and Double
    - Time (using TimeSpan)
    - Timestamp and Date (using DateTime)

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Building a producer will now create an IProducer\<T\>\
  The non-generic IProducer interface is still there, but messages can only be sent (ISend) with IProducer\<T\>
- **Breaking**: Building a reader or consumer will now create an IConsumer\<T\> or IReader\<T\>\
  The non-generic IReader and IConsumer are still there, but messages can only be consumed/read (IReceive) with IConsumer\<T\> and IReader\<T\>
- **Breaking**: Receiving a message with now return an IMessage\<T\> instead of the Message class (which is now internal)\
  The non-generic IMessage can be used if 'Value()' (decoding the 'Data' bytes) is not used (when just handling raw messages)
- **Breaking**: The message builder is now generic
- Setting an Action and Func StateChangedHandler on the ConsumerBuilder, ReaderBuilder, and ProducerBuilder are now extension methods
- Setting an Action and Func ExceptionHandler on the PulsarClientBuilder are now extension methods

### Fixed

- When the broker sends a CommandClose[Producer/Consumer] all in-flight (and following) requests to the broker are ignored.\
  Even though we reconnect the consumer, reader, or producer the tasks for the in-flight requests will hang as long as the connection is kept alive by other producers/consumers/readers.\
  This situation is now handled and the requests will be sent again on the new connection.

## [0.11.0] - 2021-02-21

### Added

- The Consumer and Reader now share the IReceive interface for receiving a single message: ValueTask\<Message\> Receive(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
- The Consumer and Reader now share the ISeek interface for seeking on message-id and publish time
- The Consumer and Reader now share the IGetLastMessageId interface for getting the last message-id on a topic
- The Consumer, Reader, and Producer now share the IState interface adding 'OnStateChangeFrom' and 'OnStateChangeTo'
- The PulsarClient, Consumer, Reader, and Producer now have the read-only property 'ServiceUrl'
- The Consumer now have the read-only property 'SubscriptionName'
- All message compression types are now supported (listed below). Please read this [compression how-to](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-dotpulsar/wiki/Compression)
    - LZ4
	- SNAPPY
    - ZLIB
    - ZSTD

### Changed

- MessageId.ToString() now returns a string matching that of other clients: "{LedgerId}:{EntryId}:{Partition}:{BatchIndex}"
- A lot of methods were made into extension methods and now require a using statement for 'DotPulsar.Extensions'
    - Producer.StateChangedTo(ProducerState state, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Producer.StateChangedFrom(ProducerState state, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Producer.Send(byte[] data, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Producer.Send(ReadOnlyMemory\<byte\> data, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Producer.Send(MessageMetadata metadata, byte[] data, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Producer.Send(MessageMetadata metadata, ReadOnlyMemory\<byte\> data, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Consumer.Acknowledge(Message message, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Consumer.AcknowledgeCumulative(Message message, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Consumer.StateChangedTo(ConsumerState state, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Consumer.StateChangedFrom(ConsumerState state, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Consumer.Messages(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Consumer.Seek(DateTime publishTime, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Consumer.Seek(DateTimeOffset publishTime, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Reader.StateChangedTo(ReaderState state, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Reader.StateChangedFrom(ReaderState state, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Reader.Messages(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Reader.Seek(DateTime publishTime, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	- Reader.Seek(DateTimeOffset publishTime, CancellationToken cancellationToken)

### Fixed

- Before the Consumer and Reader would throw an ArgumentOutOfRangeException if they encountered a compressed message. Now they will throw a CompressionException if the compression type is not supported
- DotPulsarEventSource (performance counters) was only enabled for .NET Standard 2.1. Now it's enabled for all target frameworks except .NET Standard 2.0

## [0.10.1] - 2020-12-23

- Do not throw exceptions when disposing consumers, readers, or producers

## [0.10.0] - 2020-12-16

### Added

- Added performance improvements when receiving data
- Added the IHandleStateChanged\<TStateChanged\> interface for easier state monitoring
- Added StateChangedHandler methods on ConsumerBuilder, ReaderBuilder, and ProducerBuilder for easier state monitoring
- Added StateChangedHandler property on ConsumerOptions, ReaderOptions, and ProducerOptions for easier state monitoring
- Added four new DotPulsarExceptions: InvalidTransactionStatusException, NotAllowedException, TransactionConflictException and TransactionCoordinatorNotFoundException
- Added properties on Message to read EventTime and PublishTime as DateTime
- Added methods on the IMessageBuilder to set EventTime and DeliverAt using DateTime
- Added properties on MessageMetadata to set EventTime and DeliverAtTime using DateTime
- Added seeking by MessageId on the Reader
- Added seeking by message publish time on the Consumer and Reader

# DotPulsar

![CI - Unit](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-dotpulsar/workflows/CI%20-%20Unit/badge.svg)

The official .NET client library for [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/).

DotPulsar is written entirely in C# and implements Apache Pulsar's [binary protocol](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/develop-binary-protocol/).

## What's new?

Have a look at the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Getting Started

Let's take a look at a "Hello world" example, where we first produce a message and then consume it. Note that the topic and subscription will be created if they don't exist.

First, we need a Pulsar setup. See [Pulsar docs](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/getting-started-home/) for how to set up a local standalone Pulsar instance.

Install the NuGet package [DotPulsar](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotPulsar/) and run the follow code example:

```csharp
using DotPulsar;
using DotPulsar.Extensions;

const string myTopic = "persistent://public/default/mytopic";

// connecting to pulsar://localhost:6650
await using var client = PulsarClient.Builder().Build();

// produce a message
await using var producer = client.NewProducer(Schema.String).Topic(myTopic).Create();
await producer.Send("Hello World");

// consume messages
await using var consumer = client.NewConsumer(Schema.String)
    .SubscriptionName("MySubscription")
    .Topic(myTopic)
    .InitialPosition(SubscriptionInitialPosition.Earliest)
    .Create();

await foreach (var message in consumer.Messages())
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Received: {message.Value()}");
    await consumer.Acknowledge(message);
}
```

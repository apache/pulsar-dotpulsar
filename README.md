# DotPulsar

![CI - Unit](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-dotpulsar/workflows/CI%20-%20Unit/badge.svg)

The official .NET client library for [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/).

DotPulsar is written entirely in C# and implements Apache Pulsar's [binary protocol](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/develop-binary-protocol/).

## What's new?

Have a look at the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Getting Started

Let's take a look at a "Hello world" example, where we first produce a message and then consume it.

First, we need a Pulsar setup. Have a look [here](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/standalone-docker/) to see how to setup a local standalone Pulsar instance.
Install the NuGet package [DotPulsar](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotPulsar/) and copy/paste the code below (you will be needing using declarations for 'DotPulsar' and 'DotPulsar.Extensions').

```csharp
const string myTopic = "persistent://public/default/mytopic";

await using var client = PulsarClient.Builder()
                                     .Build(); //Connecting to pulsar://localhost:6650

var producer = client.NewProducer()
                     .Topic(myTopic)
                     .Create();

_ = await producer.Send(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Hello World"));

var consumer = client.NewConsumer()
                     .SubscriptionName("MySubscription")
                     .Topic(myTopic)
                     .Create();

await foreach (var message in consumer.Messages())
{
    Console.WriteLine("Received: " + Encoding.UTF8.GetString(message.Data.ToArray()));
    await consumer.Acknowledge(message);
}
```
